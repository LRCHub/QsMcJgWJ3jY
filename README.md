[00:06.31] We're caught in a trap
[00:10.07] I can't walk out
[00:13.49] Because I love you too much, baby
[00:29.99] 
[00:21.40] Why can't you see, oh-oh-oh
[00:24.77] What you're doing to me
[00:28.11] When you don't believe a word I'm sayin'?
[00:48.61] 
[00:35.93] We can't go on together
[00:39.02] With suspicious minds (suspicious minds)
[00:42.51] And we can't build our dreams
[00:46.19] On suspicious minds
[00:55.69] 
[00:49.51] So if an old friend I know (shove it up your nose)
[00:53.26] Stops by to say hello
[00:57.06] Would I still see suspicion in your eyes?
[01:17.56] 
[01:04.06] Here we go again, oh-oh-oh
[01:07.96] Asking where I've been
[01:11.59] You can see the tears are real
[01:13.92] I'm crying (yes, I'm crying)
[01:27.92] 
[01:19.03] We can't go on together
[01:22.13] With suspicious minds (suspicious minds)
[01:25.58] And we can't build our dreams
[01:29.14] On suspicious minds
[01:38.64] 
[01:34.10] Oh, let our love survive, oh no
[01:39.43] I'll dry the tears from your eyes
[01:44.93] Let's don't let a good thing die, oh no
[01:50.68] 'Cause honey, you know I've never lied to you
[01:56.78] Ooh-ooh-yeah
